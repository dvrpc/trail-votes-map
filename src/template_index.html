            DVRPC is working with the Delaware County Planning Department to
            develop conceptual plans for bicycle network improvements that will
            improve mobility across the county by tying local trailheads to
            nearby neighborhood amenities with low-stress bike facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want your feedback to help us pick the locations for intitial
            focus! Please use this map to vote for the three locations that are
            most in need of on-street connectivity improvements for cyclists.

            "Trailheads in need of on-street-bicycle connections" can be defined
            in a number of ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Trailheads that are popular and used by a lot of cyclists now.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trailheads that are cut off from the community by streets that
              don't feel safe for cyclists to use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trailheads that, with on-street enhancements, would see more
              bicycle use for commuting or recreation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trailheads that, with on-street improvements, could connect to
              other nearby trailheads or on-street bicycle routes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trailheads that could be better connected to schools, community
              centers, parks, and other neighborhood facilities.
            </li>
          </ul>
